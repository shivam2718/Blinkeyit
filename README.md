Build a complete e-commerce platform  using the MERN stack! In this project, we will create an online shopping site with key features, including product uploads, an admin panel, and management for categories and subcategories. We will use access and refresh tokens to establish secure user authentication. You will also learn how to set up password recovery, OTP-based email verification, and secure authentication processes. This project was a great way to improve my skills in MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.
